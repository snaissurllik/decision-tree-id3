# ID3 Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of the ID3 (Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm for decision tree
building in Python. This algorithm was originally developed by John Ross Quinlan
The ID3 algorithm is a simple machine learning algorithm which solves classification problem. 
It builds a decision tree that can be used to make predictions based on **discrete** features.
